# CCO-design-patterns

A repository for the coordination of National Center for Ontological Research (NCOR) efforts in creating design patterns for the Common Core Ontologies (CCO). 
The aim of creating these patterns is to lower the barrier of entry into using CCO, as well as creating a shared consensus on the usage of CCO resources.

The main folder contains a .pdf with preliminary slides outlining existing design patterns to be vetted and translated into Mermaid format. 

The preferred format for design patterns is Mermaid, although an image in PNG or similar should also be provided.

The current style choice is the following:

- Yellow box for classes (color #ffe680)
- Purple diamond for instances (color #dbc9ef)
- White boxes for data (color #ffffff)
- Shortened IRI/identifier for the classes
- Labelled nodes for object properties
- Shortened IRI/identifier for object properties
- Explicit names as examples for instances, e.g. "Giacomo" instead of "Person 1"

A tool to create and edit Mermaid can be found here:
