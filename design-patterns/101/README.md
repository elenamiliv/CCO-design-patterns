This directory contains extremely basic graphs that display the difference between commonly confused classes and relations in BFO and CCO, 
as well as the way they interact with each other. The aim of the graphs contained here is not to be directly used in development as 
design patterns, but to illustrate the usage of common combinations of relations and classes in BFO and CCO to newcomers.
